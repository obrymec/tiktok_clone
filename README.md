This project is an academy project. This's made to evaluate React framework performances, get more knowledge about how class components work and test my capacity to make some advanced user interfaces without any CSS packages like Bootstrap or Tailwind. It's front-end only. No any back-end API is called. The main goal of this project is to reproduce TitkTok chat section using native web language on pages's style sheets.
